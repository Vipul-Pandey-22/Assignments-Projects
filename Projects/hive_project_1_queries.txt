Note: both files are csv files. 
1. Create a schema based on the given dataset
ans: create table agentperformance
(
sl_no int,
date string,
name string,
total_chats int,
avg_response_time string,
avg_resol_time string,
avg_ratings float,
total_feed int
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1");

2. Dump the data inside the hdfs in the given schema location.
ans: load data inpath '/Hive-mini-project/agentperformance.csv' into table agentperformance;

3. List of all agents' names. 
ans: select name from agentperformance;

4. Find out agent average rating.
ans:  select name, avg(avg_ratings) from agentperformance group by name;

5. Total working days for each agent
ans: select name, count(distinct date) as total_working_days from agentperformance group by name;

6. Total query that each agent has taken 
ans: if total_chat column consider as query then ==> select name, sum(total_chats) total_queries from agentperformance group by name limit 50;
	otherwise select name, sum(total_feed) total_queries from agentperformance group by name;
7. Total Feedback that each agent has received
ans: select name, sum(total_feed) from agentperformance group by name;

8. Agent name who have average rating between 3.5 to 4
ans:  select name, avg(avg_ratings) as avg_ratings from agentperformance where avg_ratings between 3.5 and 4 group by name;
 
9. Agent name who have rating less than 3.5 
ans:  select name, avg_ratings from agentperformance where avg_ratings <= 3.5;

10. Agent name who have rating more than 4.5
ans:  select name, avg_ratings from agentperformance where avg_ratings > 4.5;
 
11. How many feedback agents have received more than 4.5 average
ans:  select name, count(total_feed) as num_of_agent_who_have_recieved, avg(avg_ratings) as avg_ratings from agentperformance where avg_ratings > 4.5 group by name;

12. average weekly response time for each agent 

13. average weekly resolution time for each agent

14. Find the number of chats on which they have received feedback
ans: select agent_name, sum(total_feed) from agentperformance group by agent_name;

15. Total contribution hour for each and every agentâ€™s weekly basis 

16. Perform inner join, left join and right join based on the agent column and after joining the table 

17. Perform partitioning on top of the agent column and then on top of that perform bucketing for
